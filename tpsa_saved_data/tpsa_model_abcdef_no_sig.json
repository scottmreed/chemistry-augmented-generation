The presence of nitrogen atoms in the amine and the ether oxygen increases the TPSA due to their polar nature. The aliphatic carbon chains and the aromatic ring contribute less to the TPSA. Overall, the TPSA is influenced significantly by the polar functional groups present in the structure.\",\"tpsa_numbers_list\":[45.2]}"
